# Machine Learning Code Using Python

This project contains various Machine Learning algorithms implemented using python 3.0 compiled on jupyter notebook. 

## Overview

Each folder containg .ipynb file. Some of the dataset used were imported from library and some are uploaded in the folders as .csv file.

### Machine Learning Algorithms:

#### 1) Linear Regression
