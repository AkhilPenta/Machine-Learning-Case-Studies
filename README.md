# Machine Learning Code Using Python

This project contains various Machine Learning algorithms implemented using python 3.0 compiled on jupyter notebook. 

## Overview

Each folder containg .ipynb file. Some of the dataset used were imported from library and some are uploaded in the folders as .csv file.

### Machine Learning Algorithms:

#### 1) [Linear Regression](https://github.com/kkaushi4/Machine-Learning-Case-Studies/tree/master/Regression)

Project description
##### [E Commerce Data](https://github.com/kkaushi4/Machine-Learning-Case-Studies/blob/master/Regression/Linear_Regression_E_Commerce.ipynb) 
- Worked on E Commerce data to predict Yearly amount spent by Customer on app or on website
- Decided which factor affects the amount of money spent by customer, few of the factors are:
Avg. Session Length, Time on App, Time on Website & Length of Membership
- Data File: Ecommerce Customers.csv

#####  [Housing Data](https://github.com/kkaushi4/Machine-Learning-Case-Studies/blob/master/Regression/Linear_Regression_Housing.ipynb)
- Worked on USA Housing data to predict price of house using various factors such as:
Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms & Area Population 
- Data File: USA_Housing.csv

#### 2) [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/kkaushi4/Machine-Learning-Case-Studies/tree/master/Regression)

##### [Titanic Data](https://github.com/kkaushi4/Machine-Learning-Case-Studies/blob/master/Regression/Logistic_Regression_Titanic.ipynb)
- Worked on Titanic data frame to predict survival or non survival of people on titanic
- Used mean to fill missing values
- Created dummy variables for categorical variables
- Data File: titanic_train.csv, titanic_test.csv

##### [Advertising Data](https://github.com/kkaushi4/Machine-Learning-Case-Studies/blob/master/Regression/Logistic_Regression_Advertising.ipynb)
- Worked on Advertising data to predict whether customer clicked on advertisement on not based on data available about various features 
- Data File: test.csv, train.csv

#### 3) [Decision Trees & Random Forest](https://github.com/kkaushi4/Machine-Learning-Case-Studies/tree/master/Trees_Random_Forest)

##### [LendingClub.com data](https://github.com/kkaushi4/Machine-Learning-Case-Studies/blob/master/Trees_Random_Forest/Trees_Random_Forest_Lending_Club_Decision.ipynb)
- Worked on Lending club data to predict if a borrower pays the money back to investor or not using decision tree and random forest classifier
- Data File: loan_data.csv

##### [Kyphosis Data](https://github.com/kkaushi4/Machine-Learning-Case-Studies/blob/master/Trees_Random_Forest/Trees_Random_Forest_Kyphosis_Decision.ipynb)
- Predicted whether a person has Kyphosis or not using decision tree and random forest classifier based on data provided 
- Data File: kyphosis.csv
