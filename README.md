#### 8) [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/kkaushi4/Machine-Learning-Case-Studies/tree/master/NLP)

##### [Yelp Data Set from Kaggle](https://github.com/kkaushi4/Machine-Learning-Case-Studies/blob/master/NLP/NLP_Yelp_Data.ipynb)
- Worked on Yelp data set to predict stars provided by reviewer using length of the text
- Created a function to remove the punctuation from the review and used stopwords() to remove stop words such as 'i', 'me', 'my', 'myself' etc.
- Used CountVectorizer to convert reviews in vectors of different words
- Using TfidfTransformer created inverse document frequency
- After that created prediction model using Multinomial Naive Bayes 
- Data File: yelp.csv

##### [Ham vs Spam](https://github.com/kkaushi4/Machine-Learning-Case-Studies/blob/master/NLP/NLP_Spam_Ham.ipynb)

#### 11) [Sentiment Analysis On Amazonâ€™s Product](https://github.com/kkaushi4/Machine-Learning-Case-Studies/blob/master/Amazon_Product_Sentiment_Analysis/Amazon_Product_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)

- The project is based on providing any user, using Amazon (any Ecommerce site), identifying and decision making within initial 10 seconds on whether to buy a product or not based on user reviews given on the website. 

- Mainly, using Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis in identifying whether a review by a user is positive or not. Algorithm helps any user who goes to any product page, extract all the reviews given and perform sentiment analysis on all the reviews and give a numeric prediction like out of say 10000 reviews 3000 are positive, 1500 are neutral and 5500 are negative.

- This will help the user in identifying whether to go for that product within 5 to 10 seconds instead of spending multiple minutes reading description, ratings, reviews etc.
