# Machine Learning Code Using Python

This project contains various Machine Learning algorithms implemented using python 3.0 compiled on jupyter notebook. 

## Overview

Each folder containg .ipynb file. Some of the dataset used were imported from library and some are uploaded in the folders as .csv file.

### Machine Learning Algorithms:

#### 1) [Linear Regression] (https://github.com/kkaushi4/Machine-Learning-Case-Studies/tree/master/Regression)

Project description
##### E Commerce Data 
- Worked on E Commerce data to predict Yearly amount spent by Customer on app or on website
- Decided which factor affects the amount of money spent by customer, few of the factors are:
Avg. Session Length, Time on App, Time on Website & Length of Membership

#####  Housing Data
- Worked on USA Housing data to predict price of house using various factors such as:
Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms & Area Population 

#### 2) Logistic Regression

##### Titanic Data
-Worked on Titanic data frame to predict survival or non survival of people on titanic
- Used mean to fill missing values
- Created dummy variables for categorical variables

##### Advertising Data
